The system simulates an online library with a main GUI application for managing books and members, a client application for users to browse and download books, and a supplier application for book providers. The library server is a REST API that handles book and member management, while the supplier server communicates via sockets to process book orders. Additionally, the supplier interacts with an accounting service using RMI for invoice processing.
